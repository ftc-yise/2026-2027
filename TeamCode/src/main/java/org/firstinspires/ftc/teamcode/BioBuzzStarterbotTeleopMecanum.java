/*
 * This file includes a teleop (driver-controlled) file for the goBILDA® StarterBot with Mecanum
 * Wheels for the 2026-2027 FIRST® Tech Challenge. On top of a mecanum wheel drivetrain, it uses
 * one motor driving an intake roller, two servos which pull elements out of corners, and a high-speed
 * launcher motor.
 *
 * Likely the most niche concept we'll use in this example is closed-loop motor velocity control.
 * This control method reads the current speed as reported by the motor's encoder and applies a varying
 * amount of power to reach, and then hold a target velocity. The FTC SDK calls this control method
 * "RUN_USING_ENCODER". This contrasts to the default "RUN_WITHOUT_ENCODER" where you control the power
 * applied to the motor directly.
 * Since the dynamics of a launcher wheel system varies greatly from those of most other FTC mechanisms,
 * we will also need to adjust the "PIDF" coefficients with some that are a better fit for our application.
